# Interview Template

## Setup

Clone to a new folder for the person being interviewed:
`git clone https://github.com/chris-held/interviewtemplate.git <nameofinterviewee>/`

Delete commit history:
`rm -rf .git`

Delete origin remote so we don't accidentally overwrite the template:
`git remote remove origin`

During the interview, have the interviewee use your laptop to complete the programming tasks. If the interviewee brought their own laptop, just use the template to take notes and give out the initial instructions.
