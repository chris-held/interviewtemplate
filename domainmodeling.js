//We want to create a platform that organizations can use to sell
//their products online. Organizations would log into our platform and set up
//stores under their organization. Each store would have it's own products,

//an organization. We would like our customers to be able to save the status
//of their cart on individual stores, and allow them to create a wishlist that can
//hold items from multiple stores across an organization.
